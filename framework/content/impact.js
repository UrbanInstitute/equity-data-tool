Several city leaders emphasized that this work must start with building a shared definition of equity across city government. Without it, as one respondent noted, it is too easy for officials to retrospectively choose the definition that allows them to claim the program was a success. Additionally, a shared definition of equity facilitates better measurement and comparison of results across projects so cities can identify the technology investments that have the biggest impact for residents."

Her team realized that without the standardized collection of disaggregated data by departments across city government, they could not analyze the differential reach and impact of city programs across different groups.

This is especially true of digital services that do not require residents to sign on or provide personal information, such as public wi-fi, city webpages, and open data portals. In these cases, direct data collection from residents, such as incorporating questions on digital service use into resident surveys or conducting user research, was identified as a best practice for understanding disparities in service use."

If a city is “asking people citizenship status during an arrest, the possibility of harm to those individuals is really high—such as risk of deportation,” Garces notes. “The possibility of harm from asking about gender for a gazebo rental is less high, but it is still possible that that [the city] will create an actual obstacle to using the gazebo because people feel uncomfortable.” Cities should follow the <span class = \"sectionLink\" data-section=\"risks\">risk assessment and mitigation principles</span> in this guide to balance the benefits and risks of disaggregated data collection."
