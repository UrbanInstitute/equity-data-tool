The ways cities engage communities affect who is able or willing to participate, and they can unintentionally privilege the lived experiences of some residents over others. According to Austin Chief Equity Officer Brion Oaks, designing equitable technology requires city departments to reach beyond the usual respondents to “the missing audience—that is, the person with disabilities who can’t read the city website or the person without wi-fi living on the edge of town.” Oaks noted, “If you design around that missing audience, the solution you identify works for everyone.”"

Unless these biases are acknowledged and countered, quantitative evidence could unintentionally move a program toward inequitable results. For example, several studies have identified that higher-income neighborhoods are often overrepresented in public response data, such as 311 request data. Even administrative data sources, such as census data or city resident surveys, may undercount Black and Latinx populations."

The department’s analytics team reviewed the neighborhoods where 311 requests for sidewalk repairs were coming from against the city’s engineering survey of sidewalk quality and found a fundamental mismatch: 311 calls were more likely to come from whiter and more socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods. Low-income neighborhoods such as Roxbury and Dorchester had twice the proportion of sidewalks in fair or poor condition as wealthier areas like downtown and the Back Bay.a"

In 2018, the analytics team, Public Works, and the Office of Resiliency and Racial Equity developed criteria for sidewalk repair that augmented 311 requests with data on community need, pavement condition, and use. The city officials shared the priority sidewalk network with community members and updated it when residents’ knowledge of sidewalk use diverged from the algorithm outputs. Public Works now uses these criteria to guide capital construction investments."

The city plans to build these data resources and enable Boston to scale the success of StreetCaster to other public works efforts."
