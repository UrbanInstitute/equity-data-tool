        "content" : "Rigorous equity analysis of technology programs requires considerable time and resources—two things that are often in short supply in city government. Many cities are resourcing this work through innovative partnerships with higher education institutions and private companies. Several cities featured in this study are collaborating with universities to research policy and collect and analyze data. Austin and the <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\">University of Texas at Austin Moody College of Communication</span> conducted a <a href = \"https://austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/Telecommunications/Digital_Inclusion_in_Austin_April_2_2015.pdf\" target = \"_blank\">digital inclusion survey</a> (PDF) in 2014. Through Pittsburgh’s partnership with Carnegie Mellon University under the <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\"><a href = \"https://www.cmu.edu/metro21/\" target = \"_blank\">Metro21: Smart Cities Institute</a></span>, the university <a href = \"https://www.cmu.edu/metro21/projects/improving-digital-equity.html\" target = \"_blank\">researched</a> strategies for Pittsburgh to bridge the digital divide. Kansas City and the <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\">University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law</span> collected qualitative data from residents that informed the design of the city’s Emerging Technology Board. Cities have also developed innovative models—such as Philadelphia’s Pitch and Pilot program and Pittsburgh’s PGH Lab—to drive progress in the private technology sector toward addressing resident problems."

        "content" : "In other cases, cities can fund equitable technology efforts by including concessions in contracts with technology companies in exchange for access to the public right of way to pilot and distribute their products. For example, the <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\">City of Los Angeles</span> requires companies seeking 5G permits to install an <a href = \"https://www.axios.com/5g-digital-divide-19b70d34-4978-44df-a1cb-ae9222d113ef.html\" target = \"_blank\">equitable number of units in low-income neighborhoods</a>. Aaron Deacon, managing director of <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\">KC Digital Drive</span>, acknowledges that concessions are “how these things are done. [Cities tell ISPs] you’re going to have to give away this many hotspots or connect to this many underserved homes…. but there’s not a real vibrant debate about whether those are the ‘right’ concessions—it’s really hard to know.” Deacon recommends that cities put metrics in place at the outset of agreements with companies that are transparently shared with residents and include ongoing measurement and evaluation—especially for long-term agreements given the pace of technological change."

The Urban Institute’s <a href = \"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/how-cities-are-leveraging-technology-meet-residents-needs-during-pandemic\" target = \"_blank\">2020 survey of technology officials</a> found that many local government agencies are working with private companies and foundations to provide internet access. For example, the <a href = \"http://www.1millionproject.org/\" target = \"_blank\">1Million Project Foundation</a> (which is now working with T-Mobile to launch <a href = \"https://www.t-mobile.com/business/education/project-10-million\" target = \"_blank\">Project 10Million</a>) worked with school districts  to distribute thousands of free hotspots and computers to students. Cities are also working with local and national internet service providers to expand low-cost or free internet options. Los Angeles is working with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Comcast to provide free wi-fi for educators, health care workers, and K–12 students. Other localities, including central Ohio and Chicago, are entering into single-payer agreements with ISPs to pay directly for residential accounts in bulk."
