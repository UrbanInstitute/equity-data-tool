        "content" : "Rigorous equity analysis of technology programs requires considerable time and resources—two things that are often in short supply in city government. Many cities are resourcing this work through innovative partnerships with higher education institutions and private companies. Several cities featured in this study are collaborating with universities to research policy and collect and analyze data. Austin and the University of Texas at Austin Moody College of Communication conducted a digital inclusion survey in 2014. Through Pittsburgh’s partnership with Carnegie Mellon University under the Metro21: Smart Cities Institute, the university researched strategies for Pittsburgh to bridge the digital divide. Kansas City and  the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law collected qualitative data from residents that informed the design of the city’s Emerging Technology Board. Cities have also developed innovative models—such as Philadelphia’s Pitch and Pilot program and Pittsburgh’s PGH Lab—to drive progress in the private technology sector toward addressing resident problems."

        "content" : "In other cases, cities can fund equitable technology efforts by including concessions in contracts with technology companies in exchange for access to the public right of way to pilot and distribute their products. For example, the City of Los Angeles requires companies seeking 5G permits to install an equitable number of units in low-income neighborhoods. Aaron Deacon, managing director of KC Digital Drive, acknowledges that concessions are “how these things are done. [Cities tell ISPs] you’re going to have to give away this many hotspots or connect to this many underserved homes…. but there’s not a real vibrant debate about whether those are the ‘right’ concessions—it’s really hard to know.” Deacon recommends that cities put metrics in place at the outset of agreements with companies that are transparently shared with residents and include ongoing measurement and evaluation—especially for long-term agreements given the pace of technological change."

        "content" : "One challenge that cities face in funding digital inclusion efforts is that declining cable subscriptions are reducing what cities can collect from cable video franchising—a key revenue source for digital inclusion efforts in many cities. The city of Boston dedicates 25 percent of the money the city receives from cable franchising to Tech Goes Home, which provides computers, internet, and digital literacy training to people in Boston. This funding challenge has been compounded by 2018 FCC regulations that limit the fees cities can charge for 5G small-cell deployments, undermining a potential revenue stream for cities."

        "content" : "The Digital Equity Act of 2019, introduced by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), offers one solution by establishing two federal grant programs for digital equity: one an allocation to state governments by formula and the other a competitive grant process for groups and communities. Each program would provide $125 million a year for five years, totaling $1.25 billion. The bill is currently pending in the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation."

        "content" : "The COVID-19 pandemic has brought new awareness and urgency to the digital divide in the United States as millions of Americans have been required to work and attend school online from home. The Urban Institute’s 2020 survey of technology officials found that many cities are working with private companies and foundations, such as the 1Million Project Foundation, to distribute thousands of free hotspots and computers to students. Cities are also working with local and national internet service providers to expand low-cost or free internet options. For example, Los Angeles is working with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Comcast to provide free wi-fi for educators, health care workers, and K–12 students."
