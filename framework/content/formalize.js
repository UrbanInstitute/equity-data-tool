The process of developing the technology policy itself can be extremely valuable to build resident and leadership commitment to a shared vision of equitable technology. For example, during the development of the Smart City PDX Priorities Framework, the team hired external consultants to hold workshops with the cross-department steering committee. They identified that this process was critical to building buy-in across city government on their vision for establishing equity as the objective of smart city programs."

This process both created resident buy-in for an approach to racial equity grounded in Austin’s unique history and helped ensure the political legitimacy of the tool.

One equity official noted that their office still receives requests from city departments wanting to complete the equity assessment process in a couple of hours. Their team has to consistently educate departments about sacrificing the quality of the equity process in order to meet pressures to get projects out quickly. Interviewees identified that making formal equity assessment part of the job description for city employees in various departments—not just one position within the executive’s office that may not survive administration transitions—is critical to ensure that rigorous equity analysis of technology is continuously prioritized."

Austin launched its <a href = \"http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=279626\" target = \"_blank\">equity assessment tool</a> through a pilot in 2017 and now has every city department completing the equity process on a two-year cycle. In Pittsburgh, GARE trained 100 employees on using the racial equity toolkit to analyze how the city’s large-scale capital and operating investments help and hurt communities of color. As of next year, all city departments will be asked to use the toolkit to analyze their 2021 budgets.",

The City of <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\">Pittsburgh’s Technology Leadership Council</span> (box 6) regularly convenes departmental leadership to coordinate technology strategies and procurements and to develop cross-cutting technology policies, such as guidelines for procurement. This approach ensures that smart city projects are embedded within the work and core objectives of individual departments while removing the departmental silos that can create incompatibility and redundancy in technology systems across the city. <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\">Boston’s Ethical Data Working Group</span> is bringing together people with diverse backgrounds across city government to break down barriers between departments. The working group will focus on best practices related to data privacy and transparency, equitable algorithms and automated decisionmaking, equity and bias in data systems, and community engagement and public outreach around data; the group’s long-term goal is to develop guidelines and best practices that can be shared across the city."
