The key to overcoming this fatigue is using engagement models that build substantive relationships between city officials and communities.

            "<strong>Coordinating engagement across departmental silos:</strong> Failing to coordinate and share information across city departments can lead to duplicative engagement of communities. Smart City PDX Coordinator Christine Kendrick noted that, “because we’re so siloed in our bureaus, a bureau could be talking to one community group, and then another could be there the very next day and have no idea that [the community members have] just been asked to talk about overlapping or related topics—so there’s a coordination issue.” The Smart City PDX team and an Arizona State University team of researchers examined coordination challenges in eight different city bureaus and recommended ways to better manage and share community engagement data. One recommendation was developing cross-bureau structures to facilitate coordination and continuity of community engagement efforts.  The Smart City PDX team piloted such a structure in the <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\"><a href = \"https://www.smartcitypdx.com/addressing-digital-divide\" target = \"_blank\">COVID-19 Digital Divide Work Group</a></span>, which centers frontline communities when addressing the pandemic’s exacerbation of the digital divide by coordinating rapid, inclusive response actions and engagement across community-based organizations, technology stakeholders,  multiple city offices, and the Multnomah County Library . The team will build on the lessons from this effort to create the PDX Resilience Network in partnership with several city bureaus,  which will compensate community participants for their time and bring together multiple departments in joint community engagement to apply equity in disaster recovery planning. The city hopes that investing in ongoing networks will build community trust so cities can make fast decisions confidently during a crisis.",

Liana Dragoman, director of the Service Design Studio for the City of Philadelphia, stated that it’s critical to “be authentic in how [officials] are collaborating. Draw boundaries around what kind of exchange you’re willing to have—these decisions have already been made, but we’re going to talk about these other decisions.” For example, when designing the public engagement strategy for Chicago’s <a href = \"https://arrayofthings.github.io/\" target = \"_blank\">Array of Things</a>, the team realized that the external grant supporting the program had already determined the basic program design. The team instead focused engagement on aspects of the program that were open to change, such as developing <a href = \"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScIG6YevqzWW4d1U0eH1D2tNSQuHnlng6AMrlDE4V8Gf136qQ/viewform\" target = \"_blank\">a process for community input on locations of future sensor node placements</a>.",
            "<strong>Enabling meaningful engagement:</strong> Cities should strive to move community engagement on technology programs toward empowerment and co-creation with communities. Kendrick shared that resident engagement around smart city programs involves “a lot of information sharing at first. When I say data, what definition are you picturing? Is that a different definition than I’m picturing? There’s a lot of capacity to build first, which may not always be typical of public engagement—you’re not going to do that in one public meeting and then all be on the same page and using the same definitions.”"

However, Austin Chief Equity Officer Brion Oaks observed that the perception that the community cannot understand complex technology is used as an excuse to inform rather than engage. “There are a lot of assumptions inherent in this attitude,” Oaks said, “that everyday people cannot understand, that they don’t have expertise to contribute.”"

Dragoman noted that breakdowns in feedback loops create engagement fatigue, observing people’s frustration when “government comes in and asks [the resident] for my opinion and then they leave, and I never hear what resulted from the interaction, and I don’t feel like I’m being listened to.” City officials should plan how they will incorporate the data gathered from community engagement sessions into the design and implementation of technology programs before they collect it, and they should share those plans—and the results—with the community.
