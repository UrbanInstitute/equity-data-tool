According to Pittsburgh Director of Innovation and Performance Santiago Garces, “many low-income folks have multiple jobs and are short on income. If we ask them to participate [in community engagement processes] they’re having to suffer the opportunity cost of not making money or very scarce leisure time… You have to consider the cost of equity. You need to have money to pay people to participate.”"

        "content" : "The City of Portland’s equity consulting advisor group is one compensation model. When conceptualizing the group, the Smart City PDX team wanted to fill the “missing middle” of engagement by paying people for their expertise from lived experience and work with and in communities. Advisors were set up as subcontractors through a streamlined request for qualifications, which bypassed the burdensome registration and certification requirements and lengthy requests for proposals often tied to formal consulting arrangements with city government. The city received more than 70 responses to the request for qualifications and selected three advisors in October 2019. When the City of Portland stood up a digital divide work group in response to COVID-19 to address inequities in internet access, the advisors could immediately plug into the work group subteams. The advisors have helped the work group facilitate active participation from marginalized communities and reshape outreach language to better reach target communities. The Housing Authority of the City of Austin’s (HACA) Smart Work Learn Play program hires residents as Smart City ambassadors to build digital literacy among HACA residents and participate in the design of smart city systems and tools.

Natural language processing tools, which read, understand, and distill meaning from human language, can collect resident perspectives expressed on platforms like Nextdoor or Twitter. However, these platforms could overrepresent the perspectives and needs of higher-income residents, who may be more likely to use these systems and have the connectivity to do so."

They may not feel comfortable attending office hours or a government meeting.” Boston’s Beta Blocks Action Research program brings engagement into communities and makes smart city technology more accessible to all residents; its Robot Block Party garnered more than 4,500 participants. The Benton Institute Fellow and Chief Information Officer for South Bend Denise Linn Riedl recommends (PDF) providing “multiple feedback loops” that mix in-person and online engagement and produce content in as many languages as the community needs to enable diverse participation. Several interview subjects identified developing effective working relationships between city technology departments and the departments tasked with community outreach—such as the Office of Neighborhood Services in Boston or the Mayor’s Office of Civic Engagement and Volunteer Services in Philadelphia—and working with design experts within government as key to creating engagements that are accessible to marginalized communities."

        "content" : "Even after these barriers are addressed, cities need to acknowledge and address the fatigue that can undermine equitable engagement efforts. Residents from marginalized communities feel overstudied without seeing benefits through improved city services. City technology departments may experience difficulty generating resident interest in their technical work and grow frustrated with spending limited government resources on “checking the box” of community engagement for each program. The key to overcoming this fatigue is using engagement models that build substantive relationships between city officials and communities. The following best practices for building substantive community relationships emerged from our research:"

            "Coordinating engagement across departmental silos: Failing to coordinate and share information across city departments can lead to duplicative engagement of communities. Smart City PDX Coordinator Christine Kendrick noted that, “because we’re so siloed in our bureaus, a bureau could be talking to one community group, and then another could be there the very next day and have no idea that [the community members have] just been asked to talk about overlapping or related topics—so there’s a coordination issue.” The Smart City PDX team and an Arizona State University team of researchers examined coordination challenges in eight different city bureaus and recommended ways to better manage and share community engagement data. One recommendation was developing cross-bureau structures to facilitate coordination and continuity of community engagement efforts.  The Smart City PDX team piloted such a structure in the COVID-19 Digital Divide Work Group, which centers frontline communities when addressing the pandemic’s exacerbation of the digital divide by coordinating rapid, inclusive response actions and engagement across community-based organizations, technology stakeholders,  multiple city offices, and the Multnomah County Library . The team will build on the lessons from this effort to create the PDX Resilience Network in partnership with several city bureaus,  which will compensate community participants for their time and bring together multiple departments in joint community engagement to apply equity in disaster recovery planning. The city hopes that investing in ongoing networks will build community trust so cities can make fast decisions confidently during a crisis.",
            "Increasing transparency: Several interviewees emphasized the need for clarity with community members about which decisions in a technology program can be influenced. Philadelphia’s Design Service Studio uses a ladder of stakeholder participation to think through the different ways stakeholders can be active in the design process.<div class = \"inlineImageContainer\"><div class = \"inlineImageTitle\">Philadelphia Ladder of Stakeholder Participation</div><img src = \"images/phillyLadder.png\"></div>The Benton Institute for Broadband & Society unpacks “civic engagement” into a spectrum of methods—outreach and sharing, feedback gathering, co-building, and problem-opportunity sourcing—and outlines that the appropriate method depends on when community is brought into the project and how set the solutions are at that point. Liana Dragoman, director of the Service Design Studio for the City of Philadelphia, stated that it’s critical to “be authentic in how [officials] are collaborating. Draw boundaries around what kind of exchange you’re willing to have—these decisions have already been made, but we’re going to talk about these other decisions.” For example, when designing the public engagement strategy for Chicago’s Array of Things, the team realized that the external grant supporting the program had already determined the basic program design. The team instead focused engagement on aspects of the program that were open to change, such as developing a process for community input on locations of future sensor node placements.",
            "Enabling meaningful engagement: Cities should strive to move community engagement on technology programs toward empowerment and co-creation with communities. Kendrick shared that resident engagement around smart city programs involves “a lot of information sharing at first. When I say data, what definition are you picturing? Is that a different definition than I’m picturing? There’s a lot of capacity to build first, which may not always be typical of public engagement—you’re not going to do that in one public meeting and then all be on the same page and using the same definitions.”"

However, Austin Chief Equity Officer Brion Oaks observed that the perception that the community cannot understand complex technology is used as an excuse to inform rather than engage. “There are a lot of assumptions inherent in this attitude,” Oaks said, “that everyday people cannot understand, that they don’t have expertise to contribute.”"

            "Creating feedback loops: City officials need to report back to communities on how they used the input from engagement sessions. Dragoman noted that breakdowns in feedback loops create engagement fatigue, observing people’s frustration when “government comes in and asks [the resident] for my opinion and then they leave, and I never hear what resulted from the interaction, and I don’t feel like I’m being listened to.” City officials should plan how they will incorporate the data gathered from community engagement sessions into the design and implementation of technology programs before they collect it, and they should share those plans—and the results—with the community.
