Or as Austin chief equity officer Brion Oaks put it, “Technology needs to be rooted in solving the problems of poor people.” Respondents identified that the technology companies reaching out to cities to build a proof of concept for their new product often do not prioritize addressing the problems of marginalized communities because they <a href = \"https://www.fastcompany.com/40540511/why-low-income-communities-are-building-their-own-internet-networks\" target = \"_blank\">do not see it as profitable</a>, though <a href = \"https://www.fsg.org/publications/competitive-advantage-racial-equity\" target = \"_blank\">some evidence suggests otherwise</a>.
