            "What (or who) does the technology optimize for? Technology systems can save cities and residents time and money by effectively optimizing processes. However, it is critical to examine what or who a given technology solution is built to optimize for, and what or who may not have been considered. Pittsburgh Director of Innovation and Performance Santiago Garces illustrated the importance of this question using a smart streetlight solution that a vendor was trying to sell the city. Garces identified that the technology optimized the timing of red lights to minimize the time cars were stopped in traffic. While the technology impressively reduced idling time and CO2 emissions, it failed to account for pedestrians and bicycles. “The most optimal thing for cars was for a pedestrian to never cross the street, because [the technology] essentially turned the road into a highway,” Garces recalled. “The vendor had to go back to the drawing board to incorporate pedestrians as part of the design.”"
            +"<div class = \"listPBreak\"></div>"
            +"Research has identified several examples of technologies that systematically perform worse for certain groups, such as autonomous vehicles that are more likely to hit dark-skinned pedestrians (PDF) than light-skinned pedestrians and facial recognition software that is more likely to misidentify the gender of dark-skinned people, particularly dark-skinned women. One possible reason is the underrepresentation of the affected groups in the data used to train the system, meaning the resulting algorithm doesn’t effectively “learn” from and optimize for these groups. Another reason could be that the data used to train the model reflects underlying structural biases and prejudices. Some governments, including New York City and the State of Vermont, have commissioned task forces to develop recommendations for the responsible use of algorithmic systems by government. Following the release of the New York City task force’s report, the AI Now Institute published a shadow report that recommended city procurement contracts include provisions requiring vendors to document all data used in developing, implementing, and testing the algorithmic system (training data and input data) and all bias, fairness, and validation-testing performed on the system. The institute also recommend that the city require all departments using an algorithmic system to adopt a standard for assessing disproportionate impact by protected classes.",
            "Who could be disproportionately harmed? As discussed above, technology can have disparate impacts across communities and groups—based on both the differential performance of the technology and the potential for the technology to accelerate inequitable systems. When the potential for disproportionate harm is identified, cities should enact policies that require consultation with the impacted communities during design and for disparate impact to be measured and transparently shared with residents, such as the ACLU’s Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) legislation."
            +"<div class = \"listPBreak\"></div>"
            +"If cities determine that the potential for harm to vulnerable communities from a specific technology cannot be mitigated, then they should not use the technology—or ban it altogether. For example, eight cities in the United States—including San Francisco and Boston—have banned facial recognition technology because of its high likelihood of harm to communities of color. In other cases, the disproportionate harm may come from second-order effects. For example, technology investments such as smart infrastructure can accelerate displacement pressures in low-income neighborhoods by increasing rents and property values. Cities should pair companion policies, such as affordable housing policy, with smart city implementation to address these second-order effects.",
            "Who could be excluded? Cities also need to examine whether a given technology program could exclude certain residents. When Philadelphia rolled out its Indigo dockless bike system in 2015, it recognized that a card-based payment system would exclude unbanked people and included the PayNearMe program to enable cash payments—becoming the first city to include a cash payment option for bikeshare at launch. One dimension for exclusion that is particularly relevant to technology programs is the digital divide—a lack of access to the internet, internet-enabled devices, and/or digital literacy that is disproportionately concentrated in rural and low-income communities. As governments increasingly digitize services, they must maintain high-quality offline options for those who cannot or prefer not to use online services and undertake efforts to close the digital divide. Adapting government programs to technological change is also critical to ensuring that the individuals who rely on these programs are not excluded from the benefits of new technologies. For example, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) lacked an online purchasing option in most states. This inequitable access to online purchasing technology increased health risks for SNAP beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic and prompted USDA to rapidly expand its SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot."

Anne Schwieger, Broadband and Digital Equity Advocate for the City of Boston, notes that “the reason we have digital equity issue in Boston is because of market failure.” They noted that, for many years, about 90 percent of Boston households had only one internet service provider, and that “making sure there is as much competition as possible” will serve to expand coverage and options for low-income residents. Boston is reforming the permitting process to reduce barriers for new providers and creating the Broadband Ready Buildings Questionnaire to ensure that new development maximizes resident broadband choice. Los Angeles is using its permitting power to ensure that low-income neighborhoods are included in private 5G development efforts by requiring companies to have equitable coverage in wealthy and “digitally impoverished” neighborhoods. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, cities across the United States are working with private companies in new ways to close the digital divide (box 5)."

Yet many households in the United States lack the necessary internet connectivity, access to connected devices, and digital literacy to effectively work, educate, and engage online. In 221 large and medium-sized US cities, at least 30 percent of all households still lacked a wireline broadband connection (e.g., cable, fiber optic, or DSL) in 2018.a In 92 cities, at least one in five households had no broadband internet of any type, including cellular data plans.

Liana Dragoman, director of Philadelphia’s Service Design Studio, noted that the “design and development community still tends to be largely white, cis-gender, male, and upper or middle class… representation matters, especially when you’re designing products or services that reflect a whole population of people.” To create a design department that reflects the city, Dragoman has found that reaching out to broad audiences—by speaking at public schools, career fairs, and other platforms outside the typical tech-oriented events—is critical to building a diverse network to contact when the department has job openings. Cities are also working to build a more diverse pipeline into the technology workforce. For example, Pittsburgh’s Rec2Tech program provides free after-school science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) programming and meals in the city’s recreation centers to get a diverse group of students interested in STEAM subjects and careers. Efforts like Rec2Tech represent the city’s role in ensuring an inclusive and diverse pipeline for future work."
