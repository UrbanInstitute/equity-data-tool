        "content" : "As cities rapidly integrate technology in all aspects of governance, critics are concerned that smart cities could exacerbate inequalities, including the digital divide between households with and without internet access and the disproportionate surveillance of communities of color. Advocates for smart cities contend that adopting technology can boost efficiency and help cities advance equity and inclusion (PDF). The potential for technology to both ameliorate and exacerbate inequities has been thrown into stark relief by the COVID-19 pandemic: as cities leverage technology to provide new digital services and forms of engagement, residents impacted by the digital divide—who are disproportionately low income and people of color—will be left further behind. Digital contact-tracing technology could be a vital tool for containing the spread of COVID-19, yet it may be less effective for the very groups hit hardest by COVID-19, require smartphones that are disproportionately not owned by vulnerable groups, and raise privacy and discrimination concerns for communities of color. COVID-19 has underscored the need to center equity in city technology programs."

We interviewed 39 city officials and community organization representatives in Austin, Texas; Boston, Massachusetts; Kansas City, Missouri; Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Portland, Oregon, about the challenges and opportunities for equitable technology [Learn more about our methodology]. One thing immediately became clear: successful cities make equity a central goal of their technological innovations."

We heard during our research that city officials often face pressure to address complex structural inequities with the “quick fixes” promised by technology companies. As Austin’s Chief Equity Officer Brion Oaks acknowledged, “A lot of times technology is seen as a fix of a creepy, scary problem that we don’t want to really open up.” Smart City PDX Coordinator Christine Kendrick shared that “Being able to say no [to technology] is key to building community trust, but that’s only possible when you are strong in your equity principles.” We hope that this guide helps cities define and implement strong equitable technology principles."
