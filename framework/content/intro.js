We heard during our research that city officials often face pressure to address complex structural inequities with the “quick fixes” promised by technology companies. As Austin’s Chief Equity Officer Brion Oaks acknowledged, “A lot of times technology is seen as a fix of a creepy, scary problem that we don’t want to really open up.” Smart City PDX Coordinator Christine Kendrick shared that “Being able to say no [to technology] is key to building community trust, but that’s only possible when you are strong in your equity principles.” We hope that this guide helps cities define and implement strong equitable technology principles."
