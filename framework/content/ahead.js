While the working group website lists a <a href = \"https://emergingtech.sfgov.org/participants\" target = \"_blank\">diverse group of participants</a> in the five public meetings, some participants levied charges that <a href = \"https://emergingtech.sfgov.org/sites/default/files/2018-07/Emerging Tech.July 9 Session.Meeting Minutes.pdf\" target = \"_blank\">private businesses</a> (PDF) and <a href = \"https://emergingtech.sfgov.org/sites/default/files/2018-09/Aug 17 Session Notes.pdf\" target = \"_blank\">city employees</a> (PDF) were overrepresented. In 2019, the working group released its <a href = \"https://emergingtech.sfgov.org/sites/default/files/2019-01/ET_Report_0119Single_0.pdf\" target = \"_blank\">final report</a> (PDF), which outlined several long-term recommendations for the city, including incentivizing hiring policies to encourage diversity, hiring an ethical data use officer, establishing an ethical data use advisory council, establishing minimum regulatory requirements for technology products to operate in public spaces, and proposing equity and accessibility checklists to evaluate emerging technologies. The working group also recommended creating a “front door” for emerging technology within city government—a single entrance for technology companies seeking to operate in public spaces. In December 2019, San Francisco acted on that recommendation by creating a first-in-the-country <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\"><a href = \"http://www.sfpublicworks.org/OET\" target = \"_blank\">Office of Emerging Technology</a></span> to work with companies seeking to deploy emerging technology in public spaces on responsible implementation, including permitting, piloting, and public comment. Speaking of the office, Board of Supervisors President Norman Yee <a href = \"https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/sf-to-launch-office-regulating-emerging-technology-in-2020/\" target = \"_blank\">said</a> “if a technology offers a net common good, there is now a path for approval through this office.” Kansas City, learning from San Francisco’s example, established its Emerging Technology Board in October 2019 through a <a href = \"http://cityclerk.kcmo.org/LiveWeb/Documents/Document.aspx?q=B3m6jg3G5c%2BHMmNdLkJjPEmECb178EPfRbFf%2F9yv5XyqRQg%2Ft1%2FOH1GNnAWVVd68\" target = \"_blank\">resolution</a> sponsored by Mayor Quinton Lucas and adopted by the city council (box 7)."

This enables cities to establish legal and regulatory guardrails against potential inequities associated with a new technology before it is on a city’s doorstep. “Cities are having to consider amending existing laws that have definitions which may be obsolete given new technologies,” says Anthony Luppino, University of Missouri-Kansas City Rubey M. Helen Professor of Law and cofounder and leader of the Legal Technology Laboratory. He cites as examples cities having to determine whether rental car regulations apply to car-sharing platforms, or how various rules concerning vehicles on streets or sidewalks apply to e-bikes, e-scooters, autonomous cars, and robotic delivery devices. Luppino continues, “We’re going to have to revisit a lot of existing laws and consider new laws, and you have to actually understand the technology to try to parse through this.” <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\">Kansas City’s Emerging Technology Board</span> helps create a center of technology expertise within city government by tapping external experts in technology and law as voting members."

        "content" : "However, some experts we interviewed were concerned that proactive review could lead cities to overregulate emerging technologies before sufficient evidence is established around the cost-benefit tradeoff, potentially precluding the possibility of future innovation. For example, San Francisco had to <a href = \"https://www.businessinsider.com/san-francisco-amended-its-facial-recognition-ban-2019-12\" target = \"_blank\">modify its facial recognition ban</a> in December 2019 after realizing the ban would have made the iPhones it gave to city employees illegal. Cities can connect these review bodies with research and development efforts to create a base of evidence around emerging technologies and enable nuanced, evidence-driven regulation."
