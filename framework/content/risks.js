            "<strong>Implement data governance first:</strong> Portland’s Smart City PDX team realized that the city needed to pause the implementation of new technology until it had developed the necessary policy and governance guardrails to mitigate risk. This includes developing both the technology infrastructure to secure and protect data, metadata, and information through its full lifecycle and the policy infrastructure to ensure ethical and non-discriminatory use of data. According to Smart City PDX coordinator Christine Kendrick, “We needed to build the policy and data foundation first before we could try things [with technology], by taking our equity lens and applying it to a data governance structure.” The team created the <span class = \"frameworkHighliight\"><a href = \"https://www.smartcitypdx.com/privacy-principles\" target = \"_blank\">City of Portland Privacy and Information Protection Principles</a></span> (box 4).",
            "<strong>Collect the minimum necessary data for decisionmaking:</strong> Interviewees emphasized that cities define up front how each data point that is collected will be used to inform a specific decision point or research question. According to Pittsburgh director of innovation and performance Santiago Garces, program designers should tell themselves “What is the minimum amount of data that I need to make my decision? I don’t want to collect more than I need to make my decision or do my analysis because it creates more risk of identification.”",
            "<strong>Assess and mitigate potential harm to vulnerable populations:</strong> Cities should assess the potential for harm to vulnerable populations from collecting each piece of information (such as citizenship status), as well as the harm that could arise from integrating their data with other sources or using the data outside its original scope. Cities should also evaluate the risk that collecting certain information could deter vulnerable groups from seeking government services. In cases where risk is identified, cities could implement policies using these approaches:"

The draft policy includes provisions to empower residents to effectively assess and mitigate risk of disclosing personal information to the city. These include facilitating “informed consent” by providing residents with all relevant information on potential uses of their data and associated risks in a form that enables meaningful decisions on sharing data and enabling residents to opt out of allowing the city to use, sell, or share their data beyond the agreed-upon purpose. In an ongoing project assisted by collaborations through the MetroLab Network, the current annotated draft is to be vetted with representatives of multiple cities to produce a next iteration. As part of that project, the team will collect examples of opt out and consent provisions and gather input on ways to make opt out and consent decisions meaningful and well informed."
