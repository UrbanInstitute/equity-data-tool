            "Implement data governance first: Portland’s Smart City PDX team realized that the city needed to pause the implementation of new technology until it had developed the necessary policy and governance guardrails to mitigate risk. This includes developing both the technology infrastructure to secure and protect data, metadata, and information through its full lifecycle and the policy infrastructure to ensure ethical and non-discriminatory use of data. According to Smart City PDX Coordinator Christine Kendrick, “We needed to build the policy and data foundation first before we could try things [with technology], by taking our equity lens and applying it to a data governance structure.” The team created the City of Portland Privacy and Information Protection Principles (box 4).",
            "Collect the minimum necessary data for decisionmaking: Interviewees emphasized that cities define up front how each data point that is collected will be used to inform a specific decision point or research question. According Pittsburgh Director of Innovation and Performance Santiago Garces, program designers should tell themselves “What is the minimum amount of data that I need to make my decision? I don’t want to collect more than I need to make my decision or do my analysis because it creates more risk of identification.”",
            "Assess and mitigate potential harm to vulnerable populations: Cities should assess the potential for harm to vulnerable populations from collecting each piece of information (such as citizenship status), as well as the harm that could arise from integrating their data with other sources or using the data outside its original scope. Cities should also evaluate the risk that collecting certain information could deter vulnerable groups from seeking government services. In cases where risk is identified, cities could implement policies using these approaches:"

                +"Informed consent: The Draft Model Data Handling Policy for Municipalities, developed by students and faculty at the University of Missouri-Kansas City through an interdisciplinary Selected Projects in Law, Technology and Public Policy course and the law school–led Legal Technology Laboratory, provides a policy template with provisions designed to help cities protect resident privacy while pursuing opportunities to provide public benefits through data-driven services. The draft policy includes provisions to empower residents to effectively assess and mitigate risk of disclosing personal information to the city. These include facilitating “informed consent” by providing residents with all relevant information on potential uses of their data and associated risks in a form that enables meaningful decisions on sharing data and enabling residents to opt out of allowing the city to use, sell, or share their data beyond the agreed-upon purpose. In an ongoing project assisted by collaborations through the MetroLab Network, the current annotated draft is to be vetted with representatives of multiple cities to produce a next iteration. As part of that project, the team will collect examples of opt out and consent provisions and gather input on ways to make opt out and consent decisions meaningful and well informed."

If the risk is deemed high (for example, if the data contain information about immigration status), then the i-Team receives the analytical results while the community organization retains ownership over the raw data and uses the dataset for any community research it sees fit. The i-Team pairs the contracts with grants and other technical assistance to build the community-based organizations’ capacity to use the data for research."

The model CCOPS bill (PDF) includes provisions to prevent such inequity, including requiring (a) a public hearing and legislative approval before implementation, (b) a publicly released surveillance use policy, and (c) an annual surveillance report delivered to elected officials and the public that includes “an analysis of any discriminatory, disparate, and other adverse impacts the use of the technology may have had on the public’s civil rights and civil liberties.” Thirteen cities have passed CCOPS laws, and more than 30 cities have started local CCOPS efforts."

Privately owned technology is subject to First Amendment protections on the rights of residents to willingly share information with the police, but it should be included in equitable technology governance because Ring cameras and similar tools are increasingly being used to fill in gaps in government surveillance, with fewer restrictions and evidentiary standards. Cities could apply these principles by limiting the ability of police departments to partner with private companies to procure additional surveillance footage."

The OpenNorth Open Smart Cities Guide argues that the smart city should be “open by default” given the many benefits of open data for residents and city governments. Some data officials we interviewed expressed uncertainty regarding how to adhere to open data principles and state sunshine laws while protecting resident privacy as the growing amount of publicly available data increases reidentification concerns."

These approaches make it more difficult for residents to examine data representativeness as well as use publicly available data to examine disparities in their city. We recommend as a future area of research the development of new tools to enable cities to effectively evaluate the reidentification risk associated with releasing different data and produce and release synthetic data that effectively balance precision and accuracy with resident privacy."
