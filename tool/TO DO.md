I upload sample data file w/ no filters/weights and get a CORS error



- style summary stats on results page

- stitch together
    - post user data
    - post default sample data
    - post non default sample data
    - loop status
        - check if started_processing
            - this has some set # of loops, determined by largest file tests, before time out
        - once started processing, check if num rows processed is changing
            - give this some timeout, if it's not changing, throw timeout error


- fix bar category text

- error handling and post-error navigation

- what to do for sample data display page if user changes preset val?
- barchart radios income/wealth tooltip
- export data map/chart
- export chart img

- mmmoooobhiiile

- framework
- whatsabox
- framework table


Nice to haves
- Permalink to results page
- slick transitions for modals http://youronlyfrienddc.com/
